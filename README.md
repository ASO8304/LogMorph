# LogMorph
LogMorph is a lightweight, modular pipeline that ingests custom log data over UDP, parses and structures it using Fluent Bit, and delivers it to a PostgreSQL database via a FastAPI backend. Designed for low-latency environments, LogMorph eliminates file I/O overhead and enables real-time log indexing for analytics, auditing, or monitoring.
